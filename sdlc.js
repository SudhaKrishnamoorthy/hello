//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis_of_reqs = "This is the second step, in which we gather all the additional requirements through collaboration with the stakeholders to understand what needs to be built"
const design = " This is the third step, in which we will look at various options of building it and arriving at the best way to build and meet goals effectively"
const implementation = " This is the fourth step, in which the actual coding and build happens based on the design developed in step three"
const testing_integration = " This is the fifth step, in which we test the code and debug it to make sure it runs as it is supposed to and then integrate/combine it into the system to make sure it works as a whole"
const maintain = " This is the final step, which is ongoing and involves addressing issues that come up and making some minor changes to overcome them. If major changes are required, the cycle would start again from step one"
